                      <p>It was hot. So ungodly hot, but still he pushed on. Soon he found himself trapped and intrenched in heavy brush slowly clawing his way forward. He could see a faint glimmer of water thru the leaves and thorns. It was the only thing that kept him going... <!--  Flailing forward, he plunged thru the last of the brush and found himself on the shore of a lagoon. It looked as if a dome had been cut out of the thick brush that surrounded him. Gently curved walls of leaf and tree reached upwards until meeting at a hole in the center that streamed a thing beam of light down onto a body of water that lay directly in front of him. It was a deep blue pool with a shallow lazy waterfall burbling away at the far end of the crystal waters. The air was strikingly fresh. He inadvertently took a deep breath. Feeling the stark contrast of the oppressive humidity behind him, and the calm that lay before him. He heard a light giggle. His eyes snapped down and his hand instinctively fell to grasp his gun, but as his eyes met the deep blue of a piercing gaze his muscles loosened unintentionally. He was confused. Before him lay a beautiful woman. Her glowing blond hair framing a defined face, and a supple body. Slowly a fish like tail came into focus in his peripheral vision. Grazing the top of the water with the tips of its fin. His eyes widened in acknowledgement and fear. He struggled to regain composure and control over his body, but her stare bore thru him. Devouring his every thought. He could not look away. He could not move. She floated away from the shore, beckoning him to come. There was nothing left before him, but her. He moved towards the water, and willingly submerged himself in its cold loving embrace. Finding himself face to face with blue eyes that pulled him deeper. She held his gaze lovingly as the light slowly faded from the water around him. Leaving only the mirage of her blue eyes. Then nothing.   -->  </p>

She peeked around the slowly deteriorating wall, catching a glimpse of her pursuers before a bullet devoured a chunk of the wall only inches above her head. She quickly ducked back, and huddled against the wall as a shower of AK-47 rounds pelted and popped the world around her. A few expletives later and she slowed her breathing, her eyes quickly focused, and she clutched at her rifle. It was time to punch in.</p>

                        <p>The Indra Room was a bar in Germany that the Beatles used to have a residency at when they were still becoming "The Beatles". There are a bunch of cool stories about their time there. Many of them involving nudity. Room @ the Indra is a progressive alternative rock band that, unfortunately, has much less nudity, but hopes to be able to carve out some equally interesting stories!</p>
